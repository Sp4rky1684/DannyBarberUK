    <h2>Professional Statement</h2>
<p>
As a Data and Business Systems Specialist, I combine advanced technical capabilities with robust business acumen. My career encompasses information and business systems, with a focus on supporting transformative change initiatives and system integrations. Employed in senior roles across the defence, public, and corporate sectors, I've steered IT Operations, PMOs and development teams to deliver products and solutions that amplify value, enhance user satisfaction and operational efficiencies.
</p>
<P>
In my capacity as a senior leader, I excel in governance, service management, and the implementation of continual improvement frameworks. I have exceptional communication skills and confidently translate governance into understandable control objectives leading teams towards achieving shared goals. I swiftly identify indicators which define measurable targets that drive operational efficiencies. I've implemented business systems, from ERPs to CRMs, using Excel, Power BI, Linux and other third-party systems and tools.
</p>
<P>
I champion equality, diversity, and inclusion. When engaged in workshops, user research, product design, and discussion groups I ensure all voices are heard. I seek to empower teams and individuals, stimulating motivation and strengthening team cohesion whilst upholding the CQC values.
</p>
<P>
Within my first three months I’ve driven a project forward that improves how the PMO tracks project performance. Through Power BI, I designed a dynamic model displaying actionable insights, quantifying RAG statuses. My design not only tracks performance through coloured arrows but also depicts trends by comparing records to previous reporting periods. Additionally, the model automatically flags missing data providing a more accurate and immediate understanding of programme and project health for the senior leadership teams.
</p>
<P>
Although my current role is not inherently data-driven, stakeholders quickly recognised my expertise when I transformed a PowerPoint-based reporting pack into a data-driven Power BI Assurance Roadmap. Despite encountering limitations (paid features), I leveraged my Excel knowledge to bridge the gaps.
</p>
<P>
In a previous role at APHA, I built an advanced Excel tool to analyse animal import health certificate data, flagging issues that required immediate attention. Utilising ETL processes, the model loaded data from a SharePoint folder, containing files originally exported from MSD365 and other external sources. This provided a comprehensive, end-to-end perspective of each import, which was instrumental in ensuring the team could execute a robust and high-quality safeguarding function.
</p>
<P>
In 2019 I was contracted to train a team of 12 individuals in data analytics who had never worked for the company or been involved with this type of work previously. Once trained my team were required to collect, clean, and transform stock data received in various standards and formats. Part of the task, I developed a supplier product search tool in Excel which contained over 100,000 rows of product data which supported the analysts to find updated prices with ease.
</p>
<P>
I recorded stock data in a master evaluation and reconciliation data model. It compared submitted stock data, reconciling it against transactional data from the accounting system. This allowed me to produce a detailed breakdown and real-time progress report for the collection of 750 veterinary practices which in total yielded a £16 million stock valuation.
</p>
<P>
Data security and privacy is imperative; my default approach is “Privacy by Design” factoring in ethical, regulatory and security controls to ensure data is collected, stored, and processed in accordance with GDPR, Data Protection Act and International Standards. Additionally, data integrity is equally important, I often include checksums and validation formulas in my work.
</p>
<P>
I’m a qualified level 3 mathematician and level 2 data literate statistician; I solve real-world problems working with both qualitative and quantitative datasets, relational databases, data structures, schemas, and data warehouses.
</p>
<P>
Professionally, both data engineering and data science are equally captivating. I’m enthusiastic to develop both fields and enjoy being involved end-to-end. When delivering data solutions; I incorporate version control, thorough change processes and adequate testing and validation. I collaborate with stakeholders to identify both the functional and non-functional requirements, draw out epics and user stories to define scope. I love working with Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft Power Platform and Linux servers.
</p>
<P>
I’m committed to professional growth and development, I aim to advance my expertise in data domain, programming languages, Azure, and the Power Platform whilst exploring emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, big data and predictive analytics.
</p><P>
If successful, my goal would be to support the team's capabilities and become an invaluable team asset. I'd drive operational outputs through the strategic application of data and digital tools, delivering effective, insight-driven outcomes.
